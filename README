# Prerequisites

This set-up process requires a modern Linux distribution, such as Fedora 22, to
function.

# How to Use

1. Install Terraform, following instructions here:
<https://terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html>

2. Create a secret.tf file with the following contents:

provider "aws" {
  access_key = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
  secret_key = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
}

You will need to set up an AWS account and
generate an access_key and secret_key.
The instructions can be found here:
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService
/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html>

3. Run `terraform plan`

4. Run `terraform apply`

5. Select default options when running `terraform apply`

6. Wait for execution to complete

7. Log into AWS console and navigate to DynamoDB. Clock on "Tables" and 
verify that tables have been created (e.g. "classInfo", "userFriends", etc...)

8. Install nodejs using your operating system's package manager. 

9. Create a credentials.js file inside TimeCloud/lib/shared/ with the following
contents:

var credentials = {
  'accessKeyId': 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
  'secretAccessKey': 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
};

module.exports = credentials;

10. Navigate to the root of the TimeCloud directory and execute `node main.js`

11. Navigate to <http://localhost:5000>

Your copy of TimeShift is now running, congratulations!
